	<h3>Those who are allowed to enter the Bubble but are found lacking are ejected
		into the secondary simulation outside of the Bubble. This secondary simulation
		is a perfect recreation of the old world where our physical lives once were
		carried out. In order to promote an ever evolving and continuously improving
		society, Bubble inhabitants are required to contribute to this evolution or
		are otherwise subject to ejection. Residents of the secondary simulation can
		always petition for entry or re-entry to the Bubble and we encourage them to
		do so once they believe they are ready to meet the standards of the Bubble.</h3>
	<h3>The residents of the secondary simulation and the Bubble do not have to worry
		about any outside threats to their new world. The BJERG security system is a
		self repairing and evolving algorithm that automatically detects and reacts
		to any outside threats and attempts to penetrate into the simulation core.</h3>
